Python Games with Pygame
This repository showcases three beginner-friendly Python projects built using the Pygame library:

An elliptical orbit simulation.
A classic snake game.
A colorful bouncing ball animation.
Projects Included
1. Elliptical Orbit Simulation
Simulates a circular object moving in an elliptical orbit.
Provides a visual demonstration of mathematical orbits.
2. Snake Game
Classic snake game with score tracking.
Collect fruits to grow the snake and increase your score.
3. Bouncing Ball Animation
Simulates a ball bouncing off the screen boundaries with changing colors.
Demonstrates basic collision detection and animation.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Code Walkthrough
Elliptical Orbit Simulation
Utilizes trigonometric functions for object movement.
Draws an ellipse and animates a circle along the path.
Snake Game
Implements user controls using arrow keys.
Includes scoring logic and collision detection for game over.
Bouncing Ball Animation
Uses random colors to make the animation visually appealing.
Implements boundary collision detection to reverse the ball's movement.
Troubleshooting
Pygame Initialization Issues:

Ensure the Pygame library is installed (pip install pygame).
Slow Performance:

Run the scripts on devices with decent graphical support.
