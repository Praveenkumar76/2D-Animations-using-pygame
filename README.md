# Python Games with Pygame

This repository showcases three beginner-friendly Python projects built using the **Pygame** library:

- **An elliptical orbit simulation**
- **A classic snake game**
- **A colorful bouncing ball animation**

---

## Projects Included

### 1. Elliptical Orbit Simulation
- Simulates a circular object moving in an elliptical orbit.
- Provides a visual demonstration of mathematical orbits.

### 2. Snake Game
- Classic snake game with score tracking.
- Collect fruits to grow the snake and increase your score.

### 3. Bouncing Ball Animation
- Simulates a ball bouncing off the screen boundaries with changing colors.
- Demonstrates basic collision detection and animation.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame Library

---

## Installation

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

---

## Usage

### Elliptical Orbit Simulation
1. Open the script `elliptical_orbit.py`.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python elliptical_orbit.py
   ```

### Snake Game
1. Open the script `snake_game.py`.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ```

### Bouncing Ball Animation
1. Open the script `bouncing_ball.py`.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python bouncing_ball.py
   ```

## Code Walkthrough

### Elliptical Orbit Simulation
- Utilizes trigonometric functions for object movement.
- Draws an ellipse and animates a circle along the path.

### Snake Game
- Implements user controls using arrow keys.
- Includes scoring logic and collision detection for game over.

### Bouncing Ball Animation
- Uses random colors to make the animation visually appealing.
- Implements boundary collision detection to reverse the ball's movement.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Pygame Initialization Issues:
- Ensure the Pygame library is installed (`pip install pygame`).

### Slow Performance:
- Run the scripts on devices with decent graphical support.
